# jQuery-transparecy-menu
A simple jQuery menu with transparency

This code was created a few years ago. So please test it and improve it as your wishes and needs.

The overview of this script is simple: it creates a jQuery function to put a CSS oppacity (in the sample is 60%) in every mouseout (weblink and submit input).
